                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Motion Graphics is an animation that has words in it and it tells what the object of the motion graphic is.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Current Trends</h3>
                        <p>The industry is supposed to grow 16% by 2023.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Legal and Ethical Issues</h3>
                        <p>The main issues you might see is people copying or using the exact graphics you made</p>
                      </li>
                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Job Opportunities</h3>
                        <p>There are a lot of jobs up in Calgary. Some places hiring are Atco Gas, The University of Calgary, Visions Electronics, Payworks Inc, etc.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Conferences / Events</h3>
                        <p>There are lots of Motion Graphics groups such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Design Brew</li>
                          <li>Creative Freelancers & Co-working Union</li>
                          <li>Creative Crunch - London - Tech Circus</li>
                          <li>Design Lab Union</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Futurism</h3>
                        <p>AI could replace motion designers in the future but is probably not likely to. Why can't AI fully replace creative jobs? To be able to work in motion graphics you are told to come up with original and unique ideas where AI lacks the ability to make original and unique artworks. AI isn't able to do everything like a human can do.</p>
                        <h3>Where do you see the industry in a year? 5 years? 10 years?</h3>
                        <p>Motion graphics is definitely going to rise over the years. it's being used more in advertising, movies, entertainment, etc. In 2023, animation held the largest motion graphics market. In 5 or 10 years motion graphics is going to be one of the highest industries.</p>

                      <li class="py-2">
                        <h3>Training</h3>
                        <p>Employers require a bachelor's degree for motion graphics designer positions. The candidates are expected to be familiar with Adobe After Effects, Animate, and Premiere Pro. To get a bachelor's degree you need to go to school for four to five years.</p>

                <p class="pt-2"><strong>Why did you choose to go into this industry?</strong></p>
                <p>I chose this industry because I think it’s nice to see things moving in a satisfying way. Polishing and making different parts of videos look natural with motion graphics is really satisfying.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>What are some of the most important skills you need to work as a motion graphics designer?</strong></p> 
                <p>Understanding key frames and bezier curves as well as you can, because as soon as you figure out how to make those look natural, the visual stuff just kinda follows.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>How did you advertise yourself to potential employers in this field?</strong></p>
                <p>I did it in a way where I added a bunch of stuff to my portfolio and sent that out alongside my resume. I also took the internship course and it helped me meet new potential employers for the present and future.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>How do you deal with criticism, whether constructive or negative?</strong></p>
                <p>All criticism is welcome, even if it hurts the soul, you’re still getting like that raw side of people, and usually people’s gut reaction of “does this look wrong or bad?” is usually right, because you can tell, recognizing that uncanny valley is something that comes naturally to some people so it’s good to have those opinions.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>Who is an artist that has inspired your work?</strong></p>
                <p>I think as far as animation goes, Felix Colgrave has probably inspired me the most. All his animations are really fluid, he uses a lot of interesting techniques, and I find that a lot of the time when I see him pull something off, I wonder how he did it, and then how I can apply it in what I'm working on.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>What does your workflow look like or consist of?</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-2">Storyboarding and trying to figure out what works well and then trying to incorporate the principles of animation because if you’re missing some of those in a crucial spot it’s gonna suck, and then just kinda like staring at it and replaying it and editing over and over again until it hits right.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>What pieces in your portfolio are you most proud of and why?</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-2">I would say my motion graphic advertisement for a fake prescription drug called Lactic Acid OD, just because it was a passion project driven around audio that I liked and then I concepted Ideas of stuff, and then it ended up working out in a way that didn’t feel abnormal, which was rare and nice at the time.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>What is the most challenging project you’ve worked on and how did you approach those challenges?</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-2">Generally anything with a walk cycle was difficult, and I figured out a better way to do it by getting extensions to make walk cycles for me, and either using those or reverse engineering it and kinda setting the keyframes and customizing it here and there. Walk cycles suck, they suck so bad.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>What’s your biggest struggle in this industry?</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-2">Understanding how much time it’s going to take, because you can factor in the art, and then you factor in “well it’s probably gonna take me this long to animate” and then it takes you two or three times as long and there’s also export times and, depending on if you get stuff more complicated, your computer chokes and then time bloats.</p>
                <p class="pt-2"><strong>Would you recommend this career to other people interested in working as a Digital Designer, Video Editor, Visual Effects Artist, Video Producer or Animator?</strong></p>
                <p class="pt-2">I would say so because it’s a very versatile field, motion graphics can fit into a lot of things and all the skills that you learn while working on it can be applied to like anything in the industry, animation wise.</p>

                <p>Akima is a global enterprise. They created this motion graphic to raise awareness about Inupiat (Native Alaskans) and how they can benefit from their rights of shareholders. The graphics are smooth and the transitions mesh perfectly. This is a great way to grab people's attention as the graphics are constantly moving and the colours are vibrant.</p>

                <p>This motion graphic seems off-putting at first due to the music and message disconnect. But the music helps it stand out and grab your attention to stay for the important message, which is to help raise awareness of domestic abuse and recognize the signs, which is an important discussion we are having now more than ever.</p>
